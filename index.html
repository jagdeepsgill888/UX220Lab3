        <h2>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h2>
        <p>The recent film that I have watched is "Everything Everywhere All At Once". It is a mind-bending multiverse saga about an immigrant family trying to hold their family together while trying to stop the multiverse from collapsing. I didn't really know what the film was about, but I heard it was a great film. I was immediately able to recognize Michelle Yeoh because I grew up watching her Cantonese movies from Hong Kong before she made it to Hollywood. They did a character switch when they cast Michelle and made her the leading role after Jackie Chan turned down the film.</p>
        <p>The film turned out to be great at the end. It was a visually stunning film packed with action, dynamic fight scenes, visual effects, and many creative takes. It also touched on a lot of issues that are often left unacknowledged in immigrant households with a dysfunctional family structure where they were not communicating what was actually bothering them or is on their mind.</p>
